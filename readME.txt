App Functionality: 

This app displays pertinent information regarding Ether. 
It displays the real time supply of ether, the current ether price in USD and in terms of bitcoins. 
The app also displays the real-time market capitalization of ether. This is derived from multiplying the realtime supply with the real time price. 
Lastly, the app also displays the last block number. 

The app has a real-time toggle. Toggling on the switch will allow the data to be pulled from the APIs in real time. 
As well, the app has a hover capability. Hovering the mouse over each piece of Ether statistic will enlarge the text.
